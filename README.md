# Hey


Hey there, here I just put random things to test and learn new things, mainly low-level and infra code. I'm a true believer of *learning-by-doing*, when I want to learn something new, I do some simple implementations, Whether if Parallelism, a programming language, IaC, or anything else.

The code here could contain things from many years ago or also new things. In either case, you could find ugly and odd stuff that may reveal my past (or current) ignorance. Please do not judge me...ðŸ˜‰
